This project utilizes python to create an interactive program that features functions and basic python elements. 
Created Date: 1/8/23. This program will call three different functions that change or access the global cupcake menu and cupcake cost variables. I utilized various conditional statements to error check input statements and ensure the function ran under specified conditions to improve efficiency and reduce errors. Throughout the process of creating this program I encountered challenges when trying to calculate the total cost of the userpick cupcakes. This lead me to create a an empty list to hold the various costs of the chosen cupcakes. I learned to understand the difference between local variables and global variables when optimizing a defined function with multiple tasks. I feel happy with the outcome of this program. In conclusion, this program was able to run successfully and perform task goals.
